# Vision-Based Vehicle Detection & Safety Monitoring

## Overview
Developed vision-based vehicle detection and monitoring systems to enhance operational safety using drone camera.  
Implemented real-time alerts for improved decision-making and situational awareness.

## Features
- Vehicle detection using computer vision object detection techniques.  
- Real-time monitoring with safety alerts.
- Real-time email alert system with detected object image
- Automatic document creation based on object detection time and date
- System demonstration for stakeholders.  

## Technologies
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- PyTorch 

## My Role
- Managed the full lifecycle: requirements → design → implementation → testing → demonstration.  
- Integrated vision pipeline with alerting mechanisms.  
- Delivered proof-of-concept demonstrations.  

## Results
- Improved safety monitoring and reduced response times.  
- Increased trust in automated monitoring systems.
